    "description": "I'm an open-source contributor and community speaker focused on practical AI adoption and tooling. This Gemini-based MCP desktop app is one of my FOSS contributions to the AI developer ecosystem from India to enable even non programmers use MCP without knowing what github is via drag and drop. I’ve recently conducted sessions like 'MCP 101 with Gemini' and a full-day workshop on A2A and MCP, with the goal of making advanced AI tooling accessible to all.\n\nYou can also connect with me on LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/in/devsm/",
